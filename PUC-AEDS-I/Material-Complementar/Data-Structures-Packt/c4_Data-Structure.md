# Chapter 4 - Data Structure
* A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
* They can be:
  * Primitive(predefined way of storing data):
    * Integers
    * Float
    * Characters
    * Pointers
  * Non-Primitive(user-defined way of storing data):
    * Linear(sequential)
      - Array
      - Stacks
      - Queue
      - Linked List
    * Non-Linear(non-sequential) 
      - Graphs
      - Trees

* DIFFERENT TASKS REQUIRE DIFFERENT DATA STRUCTURES. E.g.:
  * While retrieving value, array is better than linked list
  * While deleting value linked list is better than array
