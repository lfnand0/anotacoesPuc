# Chapter 3 - Essential Concepts - 1

## Memory
  * Usually divided into Memory Slots = 8 bit
    * 8 bit = 1 Byte
  * Integers take 32 bits of space

## Logarithm
  * logb(x) = y   =>   b^y = x
  * CS MOSTLY uses log of base 2, since we usually are dealing with binary value
    * So, when you see log(x), it will probably be log2(x) (and not log10(x) or ln(x))
